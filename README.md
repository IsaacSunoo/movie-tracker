# Movie Tracker
Movie Track allows users to see the latest releases hitting theaters. Users can also create accounts, log in, and save their favorite movies they see.

## SetUp
Create a new directory to hold both your frontend and backend directories.

Go to https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker and clone the back-end repo into your new file, following instructions there to get it up and running.

Clone down the frontend repo into the same directory: git clone https://github.com/IsaacSunoo/movie-tracker.git

Start the backend locally (localhost:3000)

npm start

In a new terminal, install the frontend and start on a new local server (localhost:3001)

npm install and npm start
